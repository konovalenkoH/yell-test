### Explanation
* The API implementation is not done due to the consideration of experience with Node.js + Express.js and the request not to spend more than 3 hours. To simulate the server response as much as possible, a JSON file was created. In reality, I think there should be an endpoint with a search parameter, something like `/jobs?searchTerm=`
* Used the Tailwind CSS framework to speed up development and deliver an acceptable design.
* Spent a little more time on the task due to an issue with using the syntax `jobs?.length` inside the template, and a quick solution could not be found. Also, one text is throwing an error.
